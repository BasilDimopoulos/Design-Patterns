# Design-Patterns
I have committed myself to learning one new design pattern every day, following Dmitri Nesteruk's guide for Design Patterns in Modern C++.
I have setup the code in a way that the philosophy of the problem and the solution of the design pattern can be seen through the comments, the code and the output with one read through.
